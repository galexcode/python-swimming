===========================================================================

Python uses swimming as version control system Git repository and you
 can get from:

    git://github.com/jhg/python-swimming.git

The organization will continue the benevolent dictator model, being the
 repository before we will consider the officer, principal, and maintained
 by Jesus Hernandez Gormaz <jhg.jesus@gmail.com>.

There are two major branches, the master branch and a development branch.
 The development branch is where the changes will be added (you can have
 your private branch to you and then make organziarte merge in development)
 in that branch all those involved in Python swimming hacking publish your
 changes and will obtain those of other. The master branch only receives
 changes from the development branch when reaching a certain level of
 stability in development.

Whenever the master branch has a level of stability and functionality
 (or error correction) is labeled appropriate a new version. Changes to
 master branch merge only in the official repository, principal, and
 similarly will be made to labeling.
