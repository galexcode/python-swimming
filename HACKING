                               Python swimming
================================================================================

Python swimming is a pluging of Python for web browsers. This plugin allows
 you to run a Python program as an object embedded in an HTML document with
 some restrictions for safety and added functionality (accessible like a
 Python module).

Organization
============
Python swimming uses as version control system Git and you can get repository
 from:

    git://github.com/jhg/python-swimming.git

The organization will continue the benevolent dictator model, being the
 repository before we will consider the officer, principal, and maintained
 by Jesus Hernandez Gormaz <jhg.jesus@gmail.com>.

There are two major branches, the master branch and a development branch.
 The development branch is where the changes will be added (you can have
 your private branch to you and then make organziarte merge in development)
 in that branch all those involved in Python swimming hacking publish your
 changes and will obtain those of other. The master branch only receives
 changes from the development branch when reaching a certain level of
 stability in development.

Whenever the master branch has a level of stability and functionality
 (or error correction) is labeled appropriate a new version. Changes to
 master branch merge only in the official repository, principal, and
 similarly will be made to labeling.


Tests
=====
In the root directory of Python swimming can run:

    make test

Which compile the tests prepared (with the same options that compiles Python
 swimming) and execute the tests can run automatically. In the test directory
 find all the compiled tests. To clean the tests directory simply run:

    make testclean

These tests help to maintain the integrity and operation of code during
 development. If you make changes and modifications fail their tests are
 flawed. Before you can make changes, and it is advisable to create a test to
 check the operation.


Technical details
=================
The plugin uses as a way to extend the capabilities of the browser interface
 NPAPI (Netscape Plugin API). Use GDK and GTK libraries for the operation of
 the plugin. It also has embedded Python libraries to interpret all code
 embedded Python interpreter with and extend the C API of Python.
